/**
 * Defines a default for the annotated method, so that the Spyglass framework can invoke the method if its handler
 * annotation is not satisfied. The dimension value retrieved from resources is converted to units of pixels before
 * being passed to the method. This annotation should only be applied to methods which satisfy all of the following
 * criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method is a non-static member of an Android View subclass.</li>
 * <li>The method has a handler annotation.</li>
 * <li>The method has no other default annotations.</li>
 * <li>The method has at least one {@code Number} parameter.</li>
 * <li>Except for one {@code Number} parameter, every parameter belonging to the method has a use-annotation.</li>
